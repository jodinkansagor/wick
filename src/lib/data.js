  bio1: 'I believe that every human is worthy of a meaningful relationship with self that includes love, connection, community, sexuality, intimacy and confidence. As a coach, I help my clients to find peace around the circumstances of life, and then to find the direction and motivation to engage in healthy growth. I provide support as my clients navigate through grief and pain and move through discomfort, and it gives me great satisfaction when my clients develop the confidence and peace of mind to guide and nurture themselves as they move forward in life.',
  bio2: 'My background includes a degree in psychology (although it is important to note that I am not a licensed therapist) and over a decade of experience in community conflict resolution, crisis intervention, and queer co-counseling. I spent eight years living and working in a community where I coached a wide range of individuals through significant growth experiences, and where I also facilitated restorative justice and accountability processes. Prior to coaching, I served as program director at a nonprofit serving HIV+ young people.',
  bio3: 'I am queer, disabled, and sober. I have personal experience navigating a range of relationship structures that range from monogamy to ethical non-monogamy.

I also love horror, scifi and fantasy as well as all things dark and spooky.',
